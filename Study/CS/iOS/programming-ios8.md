## Views

A view (an object whose class is UIView or a subclass of UIView) knows how to draw itself into a rectangular area of the interface.

The view *hierarchy* is the chief mode of view organization. A view can have subviews; a subview has exactly one immediate superview. This hierarchy allows views to come and go together.

A view may come from a nib, or you can create it in code.
