Dear Students,

You may be wondering why Aetna is asking you to provide your Social Security number (or other tax identification number). While you are wise to question whenever a third party is requesting such private information from you, in this instance, there is a reason. Beginning this year, health plans are required to send the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) information about their members, including the member Social Security number (or other tax identification number). This is one of the requirements of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

The ACA requires that everyone have qualifying insurance, qualify for an exemption, or potentially pay a tax penalty. Further information about this requirement can be found at:

http://www.irs.gov/Affordable-Care-Act/Individuals-and-Families

http://www.aetna.com/health-reform-connection/reform-explained/carrier-employer-reporting-requirements.html

The IRS cross-checks the information in tax returns against the information health insurance plans are required to submit for every person they cover. This IRS review will confirm that you have the required coverage and don’t have to pay a tax penalty.

Many insurers, including Aetna, have been phasing out the use of SSNs for member identification. However, with the ACA requirements, health insurance plans will now be sending letters or otherwise reaching out to plan members asking for that information if they don’t already have it.

What if I don’t have a Social Security number or other tax identification number?

You can disregard the letter, however, please note that Aetna is required by the ACA to request the information three times. If no response is received after the third letter, Aetna will provide the member’s date of birth.

What if I have additional questions?

Please contact Aetna Student Health at 1-877-410-6560.
