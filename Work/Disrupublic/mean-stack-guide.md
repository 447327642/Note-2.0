# Mean Stack Tutorial

这是一个基本的教程，用来上手，环境我用了 Ubuntu 14.04，熟悉所谓的『全栈开发』。

Learn to build modern web applications using the MEAN stack. JavaScript has exploded in recent years and has moved from the front-end on the server-side and database. This tutorial will take you on a beginner's journey in the creation of an enterprise-style application with server-side code with Node.js and the Express framework, a database with MongoDB and front-end code using AngularJS.

## What's the MEAN Stack?

MEAN is an acronym made up of commonly used technologies for an all JavaScript web stack. You don't have to use this combination and there are many alternative choices, especially on the client-side such as Backbone, Ember etc.

This particular combination of tools has generated a lot of traction in the enterprise area and is framework based, making it a good place to start.

The key components are:

+ MongoDB (Database)
+ ExpressJS (Web Framework)
+ AngularJS (Front-end Framework)
+ NodeJS (Application Server)
